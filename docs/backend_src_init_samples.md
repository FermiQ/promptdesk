# Documentation for `backend/src/init/samples.json`

## Overview

This JSON file provides a collection of sample data entries. These samples are likely used during the application's initialization phase to populate the system with default examples or test cases for prompt engineering. Each entry defines a scenario with a specific prompt, variables, and an expected result, which can be used to demonstrate the functionality of the prompt generation system.

## Key Components

The file consists of a JSON array, where each element is an object representing a single sample. The structure of each sample object is as follows:

*   `organization_id (string)`: An identifier that likely associates the sample with a specific organization or user group within the application.
    *   Example: `"65cab23b1a4fa990cb470e35"`
*   `prompt_id (string)`: An identifier that links to a base prompt template. This suggests that these samples are instances of more generic prompt structures.
    *   Example: `"65cab23b1a4fa990cb470e66"`
*   `hash (string)`: A unique hexadecimal string. This hash is likely generated from the content of the sample (perhaps the prompt text and variables) and can be used for uniquely identifying the sample or for version control and detecting changes.
    *   Example: `"0300d4d29863f770021f948bf7c78b56712816080e87fb127d4eb6be5d1446bf"`
*   `prompt (object)`: An object containing the details of the prompt itself.
    *   `prompt (string)`: The actual text of the prompt or instruction given to the language model. This often includes placeholders that are filled in by the `variables`.
        *   Example: `"Generate a 2 sentence short story with the following information:\n\nSetting: an old stone home\nPlot: knock on door\nCharacter: an old farmer and his wife"`
*   `result (string)`: The expected or example output generated by a language model when given the specified prompt and variables.
    *   Example: `"As the rain poured outside, the old farmer and his wife sat in their old stone home, enjoying a cup of tea, when a sudden knock on the door sent shivers down their spines, breaking the silence of the night."`
*   `sort_order (number)`: A numerical value that can be used to determine the display or processing order of the samples. In the provided data, all samples have `0`.
    *   Example: `0`
*   `status (string)`: Indicates the current state or classification of the sample. In the provided data, all samples have a status of `"new"`.
    *   Example: `"new"`
*   `variables (object)`: A collection of key-value pairs. These variables are used to customize the `prompt.prompt` string, filling in placeholders to create specific scenarios.
    *   Example: `{"setting": "an old stone home", "plot": "knock on door", "character": "an old farmer and his wife"}`

## Important Variables/Constants

*   The entire file is a **JSON array** of sample objects.
*   The key relationship within each sample is how the `variables` are applied to a general prompt (identified by `prompt_id`) to create the specific `prompt.prompt` text, which in turn is associated with the given `result`.
*   The `hash` likely ensures uniqueness or integrity for each sample entry.

## Usage Examples

This `samples.json` file is typically used in the following ways:

*   **Database Seeding**: During application setup or initialization, the data from this file can be loaded into a database to provide a default set of examples for new users or organizations.
*   **Demonstration**: The samples can be displayed in the user interface to showcase how to structure prompts and what kind of results can be expected.
*   **Testing**: These predefined input-output pairs can be used as test cases for the prompt generation and language model interaction logic within the application.
*   **Default Content**: If the application allows users to create and manage their own prompts, these samples might serve as initial, editable content.

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **Internal System**:
    *   This file is primarily intended to be read and processed by the backend of the application.
    *   An **initialization script** or service within the backend would parse this JSON and likely store its contents in a database (e.g., MongoDB, as suggested by other file structures in a typical project like this).
    *   The data would then be accessed via API endpoints to be displayed on the frontend or used in other backend logic.
*   **Language Model (Indirect)**:
    *   While the file itself doesn't directly interact with a language model, the `prompt` and `result` fields imply that these samples originate from or are intended for use with a language model. The `result` is an example of what a model might produce based on the `prompt`.
*   **No External Dependencies**: The file itself is a static JSON asset and does not have external runtime dependencies. Its utility comes from how it's integrated into the application's data lifecycle.

This file structure is common for providing initial datasets for applications, ensuring that users have some content to interact with from the very beginning.
